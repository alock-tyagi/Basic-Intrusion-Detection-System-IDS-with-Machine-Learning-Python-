# Basic-Intrusion-Detection-System-IDS-with-Machine-Learning-Python-
Design and implement an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that uses machine learning models to detect malicious network traffic based on behavioral patterns extracted from network packets.
The following tools are used in executing this project: 

Python 3
Scikit-learn – classical ML models
TensorFlow / Keras – deep learning
Wireshark – packet capture (PCAP files)
Pandas, NumPy – data processing
Scapy – packet parsing

This project is to demonstrate the following skills:

Machine Learning for Cybersecurity
Network Traffic Analysis
Anomaly Detection
Feature Engineering from PCAP
Supervised & Unsupervised ML
IDS Architecture Design
