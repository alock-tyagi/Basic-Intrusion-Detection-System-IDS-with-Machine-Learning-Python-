# Basic-Intrusion-Detection-System-IDS-with-Machine-Learning-Python-
Design and implement an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that uses machine learning models to detect malicious network traffic based on behavioral patterns extracted from network packets.
# Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Machine Learning

This project implements a Machine Learning based Intrusion Detection System
to classify network traffic as normal or malicious using packet-level features.

## Features
- PCAP traffic analysis using Wireshark/Scapy
- Feature extraction from packets
- ML & Deep Learning models
- Real-time IDS engine
- Alerting mechanism

## Tech Stack
Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Wireshark

## Run Pipeline
1. Capture traffic
2. Extract features
3. Train model
4. Run IDS engine

The following tools are used in executing this project: 

Python 3
Scikit-learn – classical ML models
TensorFlow / Keras – deep learning
